    For the design of the visualization I decided on a graph
    type that would best fit the data. I liked the energy example done in class
    and wanted to format my graph to be similar. So I chose a bar graph. At first
    I was going to do a line graph but I like bar graphs better and a bar
    graph would be easier to read for this data compared to a line graph.
    I never made any sketches because I was fairly confident from the start
    what I wanted my graph to look like. However, I did go back and forth between 
    a bar graph or line graph, and finally decided on a bar graph.

    For the color design I decided to go simple black with all the bars.
    However since the graph represents the United States space exploration 
    annual budget I made the bars able to be highlighted when clicked on.
    For that color I chose red because of the red in NASA's logo. Also, when the 
    cursor is over a bar I had the opacity fade to 0.75 to show the user that
    they are able to select that bar. I arranged my chart in the specific way
    because there were a lot of data points and a bar graph was the best way to 
    represent the number for each year from 1959-2022. I included the years along
    the x-axis to show the user the range of years and the values along the
    y-axis to show the user just how large these numbers are. I put enough 
    space between each bar to avoid cramming them together while also keeping them 
    close enough to avoid unnecessary white space. I included a tooltip that
    shows the value for each bar when the user puts the cursor on the bar.
    This helps the user to get the exact values without having to estimate using the 
    y-axis values. 

    The two questions I wanted to answer were: "How did current events affect
    the annual budget of NASA?" and "With space exploration being pushed to the 
    side until recently, what did the budgets look like during those years?". From the 
    graph you can see the rapid increase of anual budget due to the Cold War and 
    space race with the Soviet Union. The graph shows a rapid increase from 1959 
    to the max value in the year 1965. You can then see the space race start to 
    slow from 1965-1975. To answer the second question you an see from 2010 to 
    2014 there is a dip in the annual budget as space exploration was being put to the side.
    From there we notice a gradual increase in budget per year as it accelerates
    with interest in Mars and other plantes becoming more relevant. Overall, it is
    very interesting to see the rise and fall of the budget based on events happening
    around the world during that time.

    You can see the two highlighted areas in red are the areas previoisly mentioned.
